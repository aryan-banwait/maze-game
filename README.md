# Maze Game by Aryan Banwait

# This is a mini game I created using Python's Pygame library #

The inspiration for this project comes from my previos small project "maze-solver" which you can find on github.
The game models basic maze solving where a user uses their keyboard's "wasd" keys move a player through the maze.

This is still a work in progress and further updated will occur as I plan to implement other features.
