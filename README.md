# Maze Game by Aryan Banwait
The inspiration for this project comes from my previous small project "maze-solver" which you can find on my github.


## Game Info
This game models basic maze solving where a user uses their keyboard's "wasd" or arrow keys to move a player through the maze.
Theres an optional "solve maze" feature that solves the maze for you.

## Installation 
To play the game yourself, you must first clone the repository by running: 
```
git clone https://github.com/aryan-banwait/maze-game
```
in your command line.

### Running the program
If your OS is Windows like mine, you will need to have somy way of running the GUI display on your device. 
In my case, I created an X server and then ran the ./main.sh executable to play the game.
However, if you already have some way to display the GUI, then you can just run python3 main.py.
